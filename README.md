# PixiJS Customize

The project is a web-based tool that enables users to custom builds of PixiJS by including the packages that you need and excluding packages you don't. The tool provides a workflow for users adding PixiJS to the browser directly or using a JavaScript bundler (like Rollup, Webpack or Parcel).
